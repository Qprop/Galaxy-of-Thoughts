# February Reading List

February has been an interesting month, it was the month of the palindrome date *02/20/2020*, full blown worry about probable emminent epidemic corona virus named **covId-19** among other global phenomena.

My reading list for the month was intriging mainly taking through the journey of discrimination, racism, facism and global geography.

I was able to read 3 books namely:

| No. | Book                       | Author
|----|----------------------------| --------
| 1.  | Killing the mocking bird   | Harper Lee
| 2.  | Prisoners of Geography     | Tim Marshall
| 3.  | The tattooist of Auschwitz | Heather Morris


Setting of **Killing the mocking bird** is 1930's down south America, small town in Alabama. Normal rumblings of typical small towns back then, struggling families former larger land owners, third generation slave owners. New settlements of new people around the area from different parts of the world.

Narration from a young sort of rebel girl's view point of the town, different social dynamics cutting around. Jen's Attiksons father is of a different breed of town folks, very liberal in both thoughts and raising his kids a lone having been widowed for a while. 
Mr. Attikson being a lawyer also adds up to his very opinionated laid back and very thoughtful.
The author takes time to showcase the different divides within white household families and also the divide between the races. Both from a social and economical point of view.

Which leads to the main story, conviction of a black man accused of raping a white lady. This tears down the Attiksons with the towns folks who are thirsty for blood of Mr. Thompson.
The case proceedings in court seemed to favor Mr. Thompson the accused with all evidence pointing to his acquital only for the jury to find him guilty and given a jail term.
Eventually this leds to his suicide, this changes the Attiksons family the towns people and the narrator herself Jen. 
Coincidentally February is black history month. Very intriging read, nice narrative flow perfect and easy to understand.
