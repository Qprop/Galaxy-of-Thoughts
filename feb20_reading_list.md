# February Reading List

February has been an interesting month, it was the month of the palindrome date *02/20/2020*, full blown worry about probable emminent epidemic corona virus named **covId-19** among other global phenomena.

My reading list for the month was intriging mainly taking through the journey of discrimination, racism, facism and global geography.

I was able to read 3 books namely:

| No. | Book                       | Author
|----|----------------------------| --------
| 1.  | Killing the mocking bird   | Harper Lee
| 2.  | Prisoners of Geography     | Tim Marshall
| 3.  | The tattooist of Auschwitz | Heather Morris
| 4.  | Never Split the Difference | Christopher Voss

**Killing the mocking bird**

Setting of **Killing the mocking bird** is 1930's down south America, small town in Alabama. Normal rumblings of typical small towns back then, struggling families former larger land owners, third generation slave owners. New settlements of new people around the area from different parts of the world.

Narration from a young sort of rebel girl's view point of the town, different social dynamics cutting around. Jen's Attiksons father is of a different breed of town folks, very liberal in both thoughts and raising his kids a lone having been widowed for a while. 
Mr. Attikson being a lawyer also adds up to his very opinionated laid back and very thoughtful.
The author takes time to showcase the different divides within white household families and also the divide between the races. Both from a social and economical point of view.

Which leads to the main story, conviction of a black man accused of raping a white lady. This tears down the Attiksons with the towns folks who are thirsty for blood of Mr. Thompson.
The case proceedings in court seemed to favor Mr. Thompson the accused with all evidence pointing to his acquital only for the jury to find him guilty and given a jail term.
Eventually this leds to his suicide, this changes the Attiksons family the towns people and the narrator herself Jen. 
Coincidentally February is black history month. Very intriging read, nice narrative flow perfect and easy to understand. 


**Prisoners of Geography**

Geography's impact on current world order plays considerably crucial place. Focus on ten main geographical landmass others made up of a single country and others continents.

- Russia
- China
- United States
- Western Europe
- United Kingdom
- Africa
- The middle east
- India and Pakistan
- Korea and Japan
- Latin America
- Arctic

>> Geography affects relations of countries and region, exacerbated by resources for wealth creation and further more for defense and war. Be it you are behind a massive natural wall like the Himalayas separating the China and India or you are divided at the upper stream of a non navigable water way that impedes trade and commerce.

Interests are being safe guarded, trade routes protected, future allies are being created while past history is still the proverbial thorn in the flesh for most countries.
Super powers are realigning now more than ever security and threat is being hightened all over, with more millitary installments being done in other countries far from mother country.
Overtly shifts are happening, more movement increased tensions, alliegience realignment. New territorial disputes for example in the artic which was not a sour thump few centuries ago.
Resource being exploited and traded globally determines your control of the world market for example russian powering most nordic and extreme eastern europe countries makes them have somewhat symbiotic understanding.

Dynamism in international diplomacy relations doesn't make it easy to predict but for sure we are able to hypothesis.
