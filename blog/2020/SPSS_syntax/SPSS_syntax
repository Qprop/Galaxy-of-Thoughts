Been fondling for long the idea of having a simplified data wrangling session training for SPSS. Being using it for some years now and still find it very interesting, probably because of my background in statistics but nonetheless everyone should learn how to use. Caveat this will not go through the normal menu options of point and click but I will see how to encorporate it, won't promise though.

I had used SPSS back in my undergraduate level for my project, admit I was comfortable with the basic imputations that were available none of the complex functions found within the various modules. My first manage in employemnet day one asks me do you know "Ctabs"? That question still reverbaratees in my mind to date.
